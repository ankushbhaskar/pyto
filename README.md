### Requirement

This Python course will be based upon the Python 3.x version (with backward-compatibility notations for Python 2.x where applicable) via the free Anaconda distribution/bundled software. This distribution contains many Python packages/utilities that go beyond the needs of scientific or engineering computation, analysis, and visualization. Each participant is expected to obtain the following piece of software for their laptop:

[Anaconda Download](http://www.anaconda.com/download/)

__Note:__ Please download and use the command-line installer designated for your operation system rather than any graphical installer (Anaconda Navigator included). If you do not know how to use the command-line, please email us for further instructions. Also, at the end of the installation prompts, you are asked to install Microsoft’s VSCode software suite. We will NOT be using this as we will be using the Jupyter Notebook that is included in the download.  
[http://jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org/)

With Anaconda bundled by Continuum, your needs may extend what they deem appropriate and such information about this will be provided later in the lectures.

### Optional

All presentation materials are kept in a Git version control repository hosted here on GitHub. To access this repository locally, you need to install the Git software available at [http://git-scm.com/download/](http://git-scm.com/download/). To make it more simplified, I do not use the Git GUI Client, but rather from within the Jupyter notebook or command line (Git Bash for Windows users).

To clone the training material, issue the following command (from your terminal or Git Bash - Windows Users):
`git clone https://github.com/edmondb/pyto.git`

You do not need to have a GitHub account to perform this and obtain the material online. If you would rather download a single snapshot .zip file of the presentations, you can do so via
  [http://github.com/edmondb/pyto/archive/master.zip](http://github.com/edmondb/pyto/archive/master.zip)

As we move along, we may update the presentations to make minor corrections or add content that would be beneficial to your learning. In addition to these, solutions to the exercises will be provided through the Git repository by the end of each day.

__Note:__ If you download the .zip file, you will not be able to update these files using Git. You will have to re-download the .zip file to obtain the latest presentations.

Before taking this course, we will be using a free Python distribution called Anaconda. It contains many Python packages/utilities beyond the needs for scientific computing and analysis.
